# Integrating pre-commit in Django
To integrate pre-commit in a Django project, follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit in your project's virtual environment. You can install it using pip:

        pip install pre-commit

2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your project's root directory. This file specifies the hooks that will be run against your code. For example:

        repos:
        - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
          rev: v2.3.0
          hooks:
          - id: check-yaml
          - id: end-of-file-fixer
          - id: trailing-whitespace
        - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
          rev: 22.10.0
          hooks:
          - id: black

This configuration includes hooks for checking YAML files, fixing end-of-file issues, trimming trailing whitespace, and formatting Python code with Black.

3. Initialize a new repository and add all changed files, but do not commit them yet:

        git init
        git add .

4. Install the pre-commit hook scripts in your repository:

        pre-commit install

This command sets up the git hook scripts so that pre-commit will run automatically on any future git commit command.

5. Run the pre-commit hooks against all files to ensure everything is set up correctly:

        pre-commit run --all-files

This command is useful when adding new hooks, as it runs the hooks against all files rather than just the changed files.

6. Stage the changes and commit them:

        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit with pre-commit hooks"

By following these steps, you can integrate pre-commit into your Django project to improve code quality and catch issues before committing changes.
